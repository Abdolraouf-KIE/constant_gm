# constant_gm
Reference current generator circuits must be designed so that they provide a constant current regardless of supply voltage variation. This project involved the systematic approach in design of such circuit using theory and aid from Mentor Graphic. By the end the design produced a reference current of 1uA with only 0.035u sensitivity to supply voltage of 1.2V.
